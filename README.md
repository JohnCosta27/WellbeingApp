# Wellbeing App

## Backend

We are using firebase, and firebase emulators to locally develop.

## TODO

- [ ] Finish MyProgress page (Involves phone screen compatibility)
  - [ ] Refactoring into smaller components (Currently its in one big one)
  - [ ] Make it look nice, design wise (This will involve designing actual UI components).
- [ ] Who Page
  - [ ] Make the past brands a bit nicer to look at.
  - [ ] Make it obvious what each thing does.
- [ ] How page
  - [ ] Wellness check, previous words design.


## BUGS

- [ ] The user needs to have 1 brand without a date, the system should just select the most recent one in the case they have 1 brand with a date.
- [ ] The Ibrands need to allow more only 1 of each brand to be selected (maybe with a count?) this will make the word cloud better!
